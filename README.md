# Optical Charatcer Recognition to Speech

## [Required Config]

- Python 3.6+
- Python Imaging Libary (Pillow) for reading imagesÂ 
- Python Tesseract (OCR Tool) for converting picture to text
- gTTS (Google Text-to-speech) for converting text to sound

## Installation
To use the pytesseract package you'll also need to install the [Google Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

Run ```pip freeze requirements.txt``` to install the required packages

Double check that you have either PIL (Python Imaging Library) or Pillow (fork) in PATH

**Now, all you have to do is add/change the 'image.jpg' file in root to your liking and run ```python3 main.py``` !**

- I'm interested in learning more about automating data extraction. Once I get comfortable enough with these libraries I plan to create a Twitter bot that when called upon will extract the text from any tweet. c:
